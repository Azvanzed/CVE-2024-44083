# CVE-2024-44083
Crashes IDA (all versions) upon opening the malicious binary. 

# Compatibility
This was tested for x86_64 PE binaries. meaning if you try it on another format, it might not work.
I do think that if some changes are made, it's possible to make this compatible with other architectures and executable formats.
